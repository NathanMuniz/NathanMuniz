## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ !

Hi, I'm Qubitsys, if you want you can call me just Qubit.


## About me 

My name is Nathan Gabriel. I currently live in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. I have been studying programming for 2-3 years. 

I studied for many years how to learn to learn and I try to apply it to programming.
Being self-taught is part of my personality and what irritates me the most is not being able to do something. The opposite is also true, I am extremely excited to learn new things.

Nowadays I'm focus'm focused on being the best programmer I can be. Everything I do is to be a better professional, a better person, a better manager and a better student.
